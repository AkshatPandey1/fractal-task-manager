# Fractal Task Manager

Recursive todo list. Normal apps are too flat, so I built (vibe-coded) this to break tasks down infinitely.

* **Mind Map:** See your whole project as a graph.
* **Infinite Depth:** Subtasks of subtasks of subtasks.
* **Focus Mode:** Math-based algorithm picks what you should do next.
* **Stack:** React, Node, Postgres, Docker.

## Run it
1. `git clone`
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Go to `localhost:3000`
